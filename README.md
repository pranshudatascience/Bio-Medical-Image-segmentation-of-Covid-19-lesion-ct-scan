# Bio-Medical-Image-segmentation-of-Covid-19-lesion-ct-scan

This Repository consists of various Models using UNET for Performing Bio-Medical Image Segmenation of the covid-19lesion from The CT-SCAN

The Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/maedemaftouni/large-covid19-ct-slice-dataset
is being built by curating data from 7
public datasets. Three of these datasets had shared COVID-19 lesion masks. This dataset merges
the COVID-19 lesion masks and their corresponding frames of these 3 public datasets, with 2729
image and ground truth mask pairs. All different types of lesions are mapped to white color for
consistency across datasets.


THE UNET MODELS ARE:
1 UNET
2 RESUNET
3 VGG16UNET
4 VGG19UNET
